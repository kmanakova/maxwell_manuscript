\subsection{Numerical observation of traveling waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We are seeking an analog of the Maxwell condition for the bleb model, and similar non-local PDEs. We will make progress toward on this by studying the following systems, from most general (Equations ~\ref{eq::gensystema},~\ref{eq::gensystemy})  to most the most narrow (Equations ~\ref{eq::a_ODE}, ~\ref{eq::gen_ym}).  In the fast timescale, we have $c = c^{ss}$.  The dynamics of excitation are thus only governed by the $a$ equation (Equation ~\ref{eq::nondimA}. We are ultimately interested in a necessary and sufficient traveling wave condition for the general system

\begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial t}  & =  f(a,y)\label{eq::gensystema}\\
0 & =g \left(a,y,\dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\right). \label{eq::gensystemy}
\end{align}

Our specific system restricted to the fast timescale is
\begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial t}  & =  \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left(-\dfrac{y-y_C}{D}\right) - a \mbox{exp} \left(\dfrac{y-y_C}{F} \right)\label{eq::a_ODE}\\
0 & = -a(y - y_C) + P (1-y) + \gamma_M \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\label{eq::nondimYm} \\
0 & = a(y-y_C) - Mcy_C\label{eq::nondimyC2}.
\end{align} 
Note that since Eq.~\ref{eq::nondimyC2} is algebraic in $y_C$, we can eliminate it from the system. A narrow version of the system is obtained if we assume the force balance equations are linear in $a$.

\begin{align}
\dfrac{da}{ dt}  & = f_1(y) - a f_2(y)\label{eq::gen_a}\\
0 & = g_1(y) - ag_2(y) +  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\label{eq::gen_ym}
\end{align}
This can be obtained from our system given the following simplifying assumption. Assume that the variable, $y_C$, does not move significantly during excitation, $y_C = y_C^{ss}$, leaving us with a new system of two equations:
\begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial t}  & =  \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left(-\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{D}\right) - a \mbox{exp} \left(\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right)\label{eq::a_eq}\\
0 & = -a(y - y_C^{ss}) + P (1-y) + \gamma_M \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\label{eq::yM_eq}
\end{align} 
We derive a necessary condition for the system described by Equations ~\ref{eq::a_ODE} and ~\ref{eq::gen_ym} here. 

Numerically, we observe a travelling wave solution to the reduced system described by equations~\ref{eq::a_ODE}, and~\ref{eq::yM_eq} and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:numericalTWave}.

We assume, wlog, that Eq.~\ref{eq::gen_a} has two stable roots which we will denote by $(y^{+},a^{+})$ and $ (y^{-},a^{-})$. We will consider only waves traveling from $(y^{+},a^{+})$ to $ (y^{-},a^{-})$ and so movement in this direction will be associated with a positive velocity, $v$. Transform to wave coordinate $z = x-vt$ and~\ref{eq::gen_a} and~\ref{eq::gen_ym} become:
\begin{align}
-v \dfrac{da}{ dz}  & = f_1(y) - a f_2(y)\label{eq::gen_a_z} \\
0 & = g_1(y) - ag_2(y) +  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2} \label{eq::gen_ym_z}\\ 
\end{align}

We can use Eq. ~\ref{eq::gen_ym_z} to solve for $a$:
\begin{flalign}
 a = \dfrac{1}{g_2(y)} \left( g_1(y) + \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2} \right)
\end{flalign}
Then it follows that:
\begin{equation}\Rightarrow  -v \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z}   =  f_1(y)  -  \dfrac{g_1(y)}{g_2(y)}f_2(y) - \dfrac{f_2(y)}{g_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2}
\end{equation}
Multiply by $ \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} $,
\begin{equation}\Rightarrow   -v \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}   =  f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y) -  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2}
\end{equation}
Multiply by $\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z}$,
\begin{equation}\Rightarrow  -v \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z}   =  \left( f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y) -  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2} \right)  \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
Integrate over $z$, 
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  -v \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz = \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty} \left( f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y) -  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2} \right)  \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz
\end{equation}
Change variables on RHS,   
\begin{align}
\Rightarrow -v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz &= \int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}} \left( f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y) -  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2} \right)  dy \\
\Rightarrow  -v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz &= \int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}} \left( f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y)\right) dy -  \cancelto{0}{\int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}}  \dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial z^2}   dy}\\
\Rightarrow -v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz &= \int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}} \left( f_1(y)\dfrac{g_2(y)}{f_2(y)}  -  g_1(y)\right) dy \label{eq::NLMC}\\
\end{align}

The Non-local Maxwell Condition Number is defined by the RHS of Eq.~\ref{eq::NLMC}. In our specific case,
\begin{align}
f_1(y) &=  \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left(-\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{D}\right),\\
f_2(y) &= \mbox{exp} \left(\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right),\\
g_1(y) &=  P (1-y), \\
 g_2(y) &= (y - y_C^{ss}).
\end{align}
Therefore, 
\begin{multline}
-v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z} \dfrac{(y - y_C^{ss})}{ \mbox{exp} \left(\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right)} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} dz \\
= \int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}} \left( \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left(-\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{D}\right) \dfrac{(y - y_C^{ss})}{ \mbox{exp} \left(\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right)}  -   P (1-y) \right) dy
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
\implies -v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z}\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} \mbox{exp} \left(-\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right)(y - y_C^{ss}) dz \\
= \int_ {y^{-}}^{y^{+}}  \left( \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left( -\left( \dfrac{1}{D} + \dfrac{1}{F} \right) (y-y_C^{ss})\right)  -   P (1-y) \right) dy
\end{multline}
We also note that in our specific case $y^- > y^+$ and so it makes sense to integrate from $y^+$ to $ y^-$.
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow & -v  \int_ {- \infty}^{\infty}  \dfrac{\partial a}{ \partial z}\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial z} \mbox{exp} \left(-\dfrac{y-y_C^{ss}}{F} \right)(y - y_C^{ss}) dz\\
& \hspace{2cm}= - \int_ {y^{+}}^{y^{-}}  \left( \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left( -\left( \dfrac{1}{D} + \dfrac{1}{F} \right) (y-y_C^{ss})\right)  -   P (1-y) \right) dy
\end{align*}
Our Non-Local Maxwell condition Number is:
\begin{align}
NLMC &= -\int_ {y^{+}}^{y^{-}}  \left( \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}} \mbox{exp}\left( -\left( \dfrac{1}{D} + \dfrac{1}{F} \right) (y-y_C^{ss})\right)  -   P (1-y) \right) dy \\
 &= \dfrac{c^{ss}}{1+c^{ss}}  \mbox{exp}\left( +\left( \dfrac{1}{D} + \dfrac{1}{F} \right)y_C^{ss}  \right) \left( y^--y^+ \right) + P\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2}\left( \left(y^+\right)^2-\left(y^-\right)^2\right)\right)
\end{align}
The integral on the LHS is of determined sign (-).  Therefore, the Nonlocal Maxwell Condition is:
\begin{align*}
& NLMC >0 \Rightarrow v \text{ exists, travelling solution}\\
& NLMC <0 \Rightarrow v \text{ does not exist, stationary solution}
\end{align*}
Note that only the second line (necessity) is shown here. The first line (sufficiency) is supported by numerical evidence below.

After we hold $c$ and $y_C$ constant, we end up with a single PDE. Dropping the spatial term, and analyzing the single ODE we find that the ODE is can be monostable low, monostable high, in which case there is a single steady state solution or it can be bistable. See Fig.~\ref{fig::phaseline} for a plot of the single ODE in the various regimes. 

The non-local Maxwell condition is equal to $0$ in both of the monostable regimes (because $y^- = y^+$), but can be negative or positive in the bistable regime. Returning to the PDE, we don't expect travelling solutions to arise from a monostable regime, but we wish to see for which region of the bistable regime the non-local Maxwell condition predicts travelling solutions. By varying two parameters continuously we can determine these regions. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig::NLMC}(A). Here the parameters varied are $\Omega$ which is not present in the single PDE but changes are reflected in $c^{ss}$, and $F$. We plan to create identical plots using other pairs of parameters. The regions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig::NLMC} (A) match up well with the numerical solutions of the PDE as depicted in Eq.~\ref{fig::NLMC} (B), which shows the velocity of the travelling wave solution ($=0$ for a stationary solution).
